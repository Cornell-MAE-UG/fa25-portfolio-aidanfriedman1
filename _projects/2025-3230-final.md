For this project, my group conducted a fluid mechanical dissection of a four stroke V twin engine. My contribution to the project firstly involved helping dissect the engine and identifying the main components, such as the crankshaft, camshaft, pistons, connecting rods, carburetor, and pushrods. For our video, I led the analysis of the engine's carburetor, and was responsible for deriving the equation for the pressure drop from the inlet to the carburetor's throat. I identified the relevant equation as Euler's equation in the streamwise direction, and identified the assumptions used in the derivation (steady, incompressible, inviscid flow along a streamline). Using carburetor measurements that my group made as well as reported metrics that we found in datasheets, I calculated both the speed of the air coming in through the intake as well as the pressure drop in the carburetor used to draw fuel into the airstream. These calculations were later used to calculate the mass flow rate of fuel into the airstream and to calculate the air-to-fuel ratio going into the combustion chamber.
