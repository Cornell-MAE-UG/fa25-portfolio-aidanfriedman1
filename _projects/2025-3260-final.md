For this project, my group studied the dynamics of a thermostat in order to design a closed-loop controller that would allow for thermal control of a basic household space. We chose this project because, while basic, thermostat systems are present in virtually all modern living and working spaces, and their performance and efficiency matter greatly in terms of comfort and energy consumption. We felt, therefore, that this system would be a great one to analyze and study. As part of the project, we began by using ODEs and block diagrams to model the system. We set system requirements for maximum overshoot, rise time, settling time, and maximum control effort, and then utilized a feedback control law commanded by a PI controller to design our controller so that the thermostat could heat the space quickly, accurately, and efficiently. Another aspect we studied was disturbance rejection: thermostat systems often have to deal with disturbances in the form of open windows or doors introducing hot or cold outdoor air. We examined how thermostat systems responded to disturbances like these and explored ways to implement effective disturbance rejection in our model. Finally, we designed and analyzed our own system, tuning parameters and gains to optimize both system performance and overall efficiency.
