## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/aidanpic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a Junior studying Mechanical Engineering at Cornell University. This academic year, I am a Team Lead for the Cornell Rocketry Team, a team of about 50 students building a high-powered rocket to compete at the International Rocket Engineering Competition in June 2026. In the past, I have served as a Propulsion Subteam Lead as well as a Propulsion Subteam Member, and have played a major role in launching our team's first ever hybrid rocket. My interests lie in the aerospace industry as well as launch vehicle and spacecraft technologies. I look forward to applying the skills I have honed at Cornell, both in and out of the classroom, to an industry job.
